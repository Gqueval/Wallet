# Multi-Blockchain Wallet in Python

![newtons-coin-cradle](Images/newtons-coin-cradle.jpg)

## Background

Your new startup is focusing on building a portfolio management system that supports not only traditional assets
like gold, silver, stocks, etc, but crypto-assets as well! The problem is, there are so many coins out there! It's
a good thing you understand how HD wallets work, since you'll need to build out a system that can create them.

You're in a race to get to the market. There aren't as many tools available in Python for this sort of thing, yet.
Thankfully, you've found a command line tool, `hd-wallet-derive` that supports not only BIP32, BIP39, and BIP44, but
also supports non-standard derivation paths for the most popular wallets out there today! However, you need to integrate
the script into your backend with your dear old friend, Python.

Once you've integrated this "universal" wallet, you can begin to manage billions of addresses across 300+ coins, giving
you a serious edge against the competition.

Goal is to get 2 coins working: Ethereum and Bitcoin Testnet.

Ethereum keys are the same format on any network, so the Ethereum keys should work with your custom networks or testnets.

### Submission

- Create a `README.md` that contains the test transaction screenshots, as well as the code used to send them.
  Pair the screenshot with the line(s) of code.

- Write a short description about what the wallet does, what is is built with, and how to use it.

- Include installing pip dependencies using `requirements.txt`, as well as cloning and installing `hd-wallet-derive`.
  You may include the `hd-wallet-derive` folder in your repo, but still include the install instructions. You do not
  need to include Python or PHP installation instructions.
